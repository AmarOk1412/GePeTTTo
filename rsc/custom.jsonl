{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhat is a Jami account?", "completion":"Jami is not like a lot of communication software. It's not based on any central server and your account is only stored on your device. When you want to use Jami with your account, you don't have to use a classical login/password authentification.\n\nWhen you create a new Jami account, you don't have to provide private informations like a mail or a phone number. But this is the informations you can provide (all optionals):\n\n1. An avatar\n2. A display name, it's the name client will display on your contact entry with the avatar. It can contains special character.\n3. A username, this is a unique identifier and can be the direct translation of your JamiID. This identifier is stored on a server (ns.jami.net by default). Cf https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/Name-Server-Protocol for more details on how you can use your own name server.\n4. A password. This password is used to protect the account archive in your device.\n\nSo, after this step, the client will generate an archive (protected by the password you gave). This archive will contains your account's keys. And a JamiID is now created (a 40 chars length string. Technically, this ID is the fingerprint of your public key. And that's it, you have a Jami account.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nNo password?", "completion":"With Jami, you are not forced to have a password on your account.\nDon't worry, it's a decentralized system, consequences are not the same than on other systems.\n\nWith a centralized system, you use your password to authenticate on a public server. Someone who knows your password can usurp your identity.\n\n'With Jami, your account is stored in a [folder]((#basics-5)) on your device'. The password is only used to protect you from someone who have a physical access to your device by encrypting the account's archive (and don't let anyone access your private key)\n\nIf your device is encrypted, you may not want/need to use a password.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nNo username?", "completion":"For a while, Jami had no username management system. Instead, we had to use [Infohashs](guidelines/Identifiers). They are quite difficult to use for most people (ie : 3d1112ab2bb089370c0744a44bbbb0786418d40b). To mitigate the issue, we created a system that associate your [Infohashs](guidelines/Identifiers) to a username of your choice that will be much more easier to remember. We recommand you to create a username: Jami will be friendlier.\n\nThe technology we used to associate a username to a [Infohashs](guidelines/Identifiers), Ethereum blockchain, is also [distributed](https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/uploads/9b725e440c2705a2a3c4d0a3df092066/Network-topo.png), but it doesn't allow to modify or delete the association between a username and a InfoHash.\n\nYou can still create an account without a username if you wish. Please note that if you choose this option, it is still possible to register a username later.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow can I back-up my account?", "completion":"There is two ways to back-up your account:\n\n1. Link another device to your account, so your account will be in two devices. You can find this option in the account's settings page.\n2. Copy the account's archive on a USB flashdrive or any another place. This file can be found in the paths given in the previous question. In the linux client, you can export this archive from the client in the account's settings page.\n\nThe content of the export.gz is explained here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/2.1.-Manage-Accounts#how-it-works-from-scratch but it's basically a gunzipped Json (AES encrypted if a password is set)###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow can I retrieve my username without my keys?", "completion":"It depends. If you used ns.jami.net, you can't. There is no way to prove it's your username without your key (and there is no way to change your current username).\nIf it's another name server, it depends if it's possible to change the username linked. See this page for more details: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/Name-Server-Protocol###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nI forgot my password, what can I do?", "completion":"Nothing. Because we don't have access to your datas, we can't have an option like 'I forget my password'. You are the only one in charge of your datas, so take care.\nIf you are scared to forget a password, please use a password manager.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhat is the PIN when I want to link my account to another device", "completion":"When you choose to 'link your device with another account', you have to enter the password of your account on your first device and a PIN. This PIN is generated by the first device, when you click on 'Link this account to another device' (Generally in Settings, Accounts, Choose your account, Link this account to another device), the account will be sent on the DHT during 5 minutes and a PIN is generated at this moment. This is the PIN you need to enter on the other device.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow to delete my account?", "completion":"'Accounts without Infohash'\n\nA Jami account only exists on linked devices with this account. So, you only have to delete this account in app on all these devices and your account will not exists anymore. Or to uninstall Jami.\nIf you delete the account's archive, your account will no longer exists. If you uninstall Jami, your data will be deleted too. And nobody will be able to retrieve your account. Never ever.\n\n- GNU/Linux\n\nIn the settings page, go to *Accounts*, choose your account and click on the 'Delete' button in the GUI.\n\n- Android\n\nIn the hamburger menu, choose 'Manage accounts', choose the account to delete and click on the trash icon.\n\n'Note for accounts with a username'\n\nThe technology that handle usernames is also distributed. So, it depends the nameservice you choose to make the translation between a nickname and your Jami ID. By default, a username is registered on ns.jami.net where you can't modify the Jami ID associated to this username. So, if you delete or if you lost your account you will not be able to retrieve this username, ever. Nobody will be able to recreate an account with the same username.\n\nNOTE: If your account has a username, this username will not be deleted. For example, if you use the username pseudo on the name server ns.jami.net, when you will delete your Jami account and you create a new account, you will not be able to retrieve this username, because ns.jami.net can't prove it's your username.\n\nIf you do not want to lose your account, please back-up files related to this one.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhat happens when I bind my account to a new device?", "completion":"When you start the binding procedure, the folder containing your account information is simply put on the Jami network for a few minutes. It is protected by a password Jami gives you.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nMy contact is not seeing my avatar", "completion":"Due to technical limitations of distributed technologies, avatars are only transfered to your contacts when a call (audio or video) is established.###"}

{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nI have no sound", "completion":"End call and try changing audio driver or audio output device.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow much bandwidth do I need?", "completion":"For audio calls, Jami uses about 100 Kbps. For a video call, you need about 2 Mbit/s for medium quality (if the link doesn't allow it, the bitrate will be automatically reduced).\n\nIf you are hosting a video conference, you will need approximately 2 Mbps more per participant. So, for a conference with 10 participants, each participants will need 2Mbps up & down, except the host will need 20Mbps up and down.\n\nAuto-adaptation is done between 200Kbit/s / max:6Mbit/s###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhat data passes through my machine when I participate in the Jami network?", "completion":"'All these data are encrypted'.\nThere is:\n\n- ICE descriptors of other Jami users. ICE is a protocol that help establishing communication between two computers\n- certain text messages\n- as indicated above, accounts currently being linked to a new device\n\nAudio/video streams and some text messages pass through the VOIP protocol.\nText messages can be sent either via VOIP or DHT (the distributed network) depending on whether a VOIP communication channel is already open or not.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhy am I able to communicate with myself?", "completion":"Many users use Jami to transfer data from one machine to another.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nShould I enable push notifications?", "completion":"Push notifications allow Jami to operate in a way more adapted to the context of mobility (energy consumption, data...). However, for the moment, notifications go through Google's servers, via the Firebase service. Only one identifier is transferred and it is unusable for anyone who does not have access to your account.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhat is DHT proxy?", "completion":"The DHT proxy is a server that registers on the DHT for you and relays your information to you. Thus, it is the server that will be active on the DHT and will participate in the network, and no longer the target device. Multiple devices can register on the same DHT proxy.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow the username registration service work?", "completion":"For default parameters the usernames are registered on an Ethereum blockchain. By default, it's ns.jami.net that is used, but if you are a developper, you can create your own system. Hence, nothing forces you to implement it with a blockchain. You can check results at http://ns.jami.net/name/test, where 'test' is a username for which we are looking for a matching [Infohashs](guidelines/Identifiers). Once registered, this server doesn't provide a way to remove the mapping. More informations there: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/Name-Server-Protocol###"}

{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow to back up and reimport conversations and accounts", "completion":"Note: This is only for client based on LRC (desktop ones)\n\nFirst you will need to export all your accounts (For GNU/Linux: Settings, Account, Export account). Then you will need to copy the database (in ~/.local/share/jami for example).\n\nThen on the new device, when you will open Jami for the first time, you have to re-import your accounts via the archive previously saved. This will re-import your settings and contacts (with empty conversations). Then close the client and replace the database with the one previously saved. That's all!###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow secure are you?", "completion":"' We use TLS/SRTP to secure connection and communications over the network.'\n\nWe implement SRTP over SIP using recommendations written in following\nRFCs:\n\n- [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3711](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3711)\n- [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4568](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4568)\n\nTypically 2 kind of sockets are negotiated.

{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhen do public IPs get exposed?", "completion":"We can describe 3 main connectivity scenarios. A classic configuration (1.), behind a VPN (2.), via Tor (3.). As Jami is a p2p app, I think you understand that (2.) or (3.) is a bit mandatory to avoid IP leaking.\n\nMoreover, even if it's my answer, you can choose to not trust my answer and check the code, or use wireshark or other tools. Generally, I (and the other devs I think) are using the first scenario (sometimes the second one), and we surely can't test all the network we want, so if you discover a bug, please open a issue.\n\nAnyway, in these 3 scenarios, there is 3 main actions:\n\n+ Send a message (this will use the DHT)\n+ Send a file (TCP ICE connection as described here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/2.5.%20File%20transfer)\n+ Do a call (TCP + UDP ICE connection as described here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/2.4.%20Let's%20do%20a%20call)\n###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhat ports does Jami use?", "completion":"Jami works as a server and gets new ports for each connections (randomly binded). These are the ranges that can be used for each component:\n\n+ dht: UDP [4000, 8888]\n+ audio: UDP [16384-32766]\n+ video: UDP [49152-65534]\n+ SIP Control: UDP/TCP randomly binded\n\nNote: if UDP is blocked, a dhtproxy can be used to use TCP instead. Note that medias will not work cause it only supports UDP.\n\nSo for ufw, we recommend to run:\nsudo ufw default allow outgoing\n\nFor now, you can't specify a specific range to configure ports used by Jami. The inbound traffic can be controlled without issue, Jami should work and can use a TURN server if needed.\n\nIf you run your own proxy or nameserver:\n\n+ dhtproxy, nameserver: TCP [80-100], 443\n\nIf you run your own TURN server:\n\n+ TURN/STUN: TCP+UDP 3478, 5349\n###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow can I configure the codecs even more?", "completion":"Codecs can be configured via a file. In the configurations files, you can create a file called encoder.json like this:\n\n\n{\n    'libx264': {\n        'profile': 100,\n        'level': 42,\n        'crf': 20,\n        'preset': 'ultrafast'\n    },\n    'h264_vaapi': {\n        'low_power': 1\n    },\n    'libopus': {\n        'application': 'voip'\n    }\n}\n\n\nThis file is located in the same directory of [dring.yml](#basics-5)\n\nThe best way to check which options are supported is through the command 'ffmpeg -h encoder=[encoder_name]' where encoder_name can be whichever of libx264, libvpx, mpeg4, h263, libopus, libspeex, g722, pcm_alaw, pcm_mulaw (FFmpeg names for all of Jami's supported encoders).\n###"}

{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nFully self hosting Jami\n\nBeing serverless is an amazing thing I found out about Jami. I want to fully host/build my own android and ios apps and I do not want to depend on any of jami services or if possible, other external services as well.\n\nI see in the docs about installing own turn server. This left me thinking that what are other things in addition to a turn server that I would need to launch fully self owned apps.\n\nSo is it just that I build the app and put information of my turn server in the app and users who download my app will be able to chat, make audio/video calls and do everything you list or claim this app does?", "completion":"This article https://jami.net/why-is-jami-truly-distributed/ list:\n\npush notifications\nthe OpenDHT proxy\nbootstrap\nname server\nTURN.\n\nFor Turn, you said that you did it.\nFor the name server it's here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/Name-Server-Protocol\nFor the bootstrap it's here (and DHT proxy): https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/wiki/Running-a-node-with-dhtnode\nFor push notifications: https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/wiki/Push-notifications-support\nHowever, push notifications are a specific case if you want to support it. Indeed, it's Google (or Apple) who owns the server that will send notifications. Authentification is done via a certificate which signs the app. So, if you want your push server, you will have to regenerate yourself the binaries for iOS and Android.\nBut Jami can also work without any Turn server, but yeah if you replace turn.jami.net by yours, all features should work.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nIf I do not use turn server at all, what features I will be missing?", "completion": "TURN is only used to contournate the NAT. So, generally if you have 2 IPv4 behind a NAT (and without UPnP), without TURN the socket will not be created. So call/file transfer can fail behind NATs.###"}

Additionally, you may want to manually set the bootstrap\nnode's address (default: bootstrap.jami.net) to the IP address of\nanother device on your network that also runs Jami and/or an OpenDHT\nnode.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHow can I configure the audio processor?", "completion": "An audio processor allows Jami to clean up and process your microphone's audio.\nIt can remove echo, reduce noise, and equalize your microphone's volume.\nAdditionally, it can detect when you're speaking and send this information to participants in your call.\nThe audio processor settings can be set in your dring.yml file.###" }
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nI do not receive notifications on android until I manually launch jami app\nI have a OnePlus 6T and using the last version of the Jami available from F-droid. After closing all the apps no more notifications received until I open again the Jami App. I have do reviewed and no battery restrictions applied.\nIt's normal?", "completion":"Hi and thank you for the feedback,\nBecause there is no push notifications, the android app needs to work without battery restrictions. One way is to enable the 'Run in background option' in the system settings of the application.###" }
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nI also want to know which security risk is implies by opening UPnP. It seem to be risky for the user (As I see lot of recommendations say not use UPnP).", "completion": "Because Jami is a peer to peer application, UPnP is enabled to be able to use the most possible techniques to workaround heavily NATed restrictions. For those not familiar with UPnP, in summary what it does is that it allows networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other’s presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. The challenge with UPnP is that, for example, routers, printers, and other devices can be remotely commandeered by a new attack that exploits a security flaw in the Universal Plug and Play network protocol. And UPnP has a very long history of weak security.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nI worry only about CPU usage. My notebook is a bit old already and Zoom + simple Jupiter code on a shared screen already leads to lag. But I'll ask a student to install it and I'll try it in the next meeting", "completion":"CPU usage could indeed be an issue in a video-conference, as there is no hardware acceleration for mixing multiple videos inputs. We recommend to use the most powerful device to host a video-conference.###"}

{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nJust installed Jami - don't see how to call tel. numbers. Is there a way?", "completion": "Thank you for your interest in jami. you can call users with a SIP account (Jami can act as a SIP phone). But for that you need a working SIP account.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nWhen pressing the Emoji button to include a smiley or similar, the Emoji button does nothing. This was originally not the case but started sometime after initial install.", "completion": "Hi. I think some system got some sanboxing problems. A good way to resolve this would be to replace the emoji picker by a native element.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nIs there a way to use the native system theme in Jami?", "completion": "The main problem is that GNU/Linux got several desktop environments without a real common way to get the system theme. And this can generally break the identity of a software. So, for now, the developpers choose to only add a toggle to switch between white and dark theme.###"}
{"prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nSteps:\nCall friend that is using the android jami client (from play store or f-droid\nActual result: The friend on android doesnt get a notification and does not get a call\nExpected result: The friend on android gets a notification and can accept call", "completion": "It can be hard for developpers to help you with this scenario. Please provide the maximum informations you can for reproducing the issue (scenario, version, ideally logs from both sides and be sure the problem is reproducible by others).###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nURL protocol: respond to jami: URI scheme" , "completion": "Supporting calls or opening conversation when clicking on a scheme button is a really wanted feature.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nBuild on Windows 10", "completion": "This kind of informations MUST be in the README of the project or the official documentation.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nIs there an update to the guide for client-qt for windows compilations, as we know the submodule requirement has changed to QT 6.2?", "completion": "This kind of informations MUST be in the README of the project or the official documentation.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nSupport system-wide Dark Style Preference in Linux?", "completion": "The main problem is that GNU/Linux got several desktop environments without a real common way to get the system theme.

{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nBorder around participant who is transmitting audio", "completion": "Jami is able to have voice activity detection and it's a configurable option in the configuration of the daemon. The necessary documentation is available on https://docs.jami.net (in the FAQ).###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nPlease allow translation Disabled ,Enabled", "completion": "There is two ways to help to translate Jami. If it's in english, directly in the source of the project (you can propose a patch). Or for another languages, directly on transifex.###" }

{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nIncorrect contact status\nI have reopened this issue separately for clarity - this incorrect status is an Android UI issue, when the WiFi  is switched off, the contacts continues to appear ONLINE. Some service which is supposed to update the UI doesn't seem to update the UI. I tried looking in to the Android code, I am not able to easily find where the Green Circle is redrawn", "completion": "The green dot on contacts is not really for the presence, but it means that a device is announced over the DHT. So, even if detected as announced, it may not answer (internet down). If it uses a proxy, this presence will stay twelve hours, else ten minutes.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nFeature request: reduce the photo size before sending it\nWith recent phones, the photo can be as large as 5 to 10 MB in size. This causes the other side needing to approve the photo, which usually results to missed photos.\nIt would be nice to auto-reduce the photo size or quality before sending.", "completion": "I really think it's not a wanted feature. If a user needs to compress image, there is a lot of ways to do that.###"}
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nProper and meaningful changelog\nAs the new version came out on F-Droid I clicked on the changelog link but it redirects to this page full of files one or two years old.\nCan we have a proper and meaningful changelog?\nKeep up the good work!", "prompt":"There is a changelog dedicated page in the wiki of the project.###"}
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nLogitech C270 Webcam support\nI have MI tv Box (updated to android Oreo with latest update patch installed) on which installed RING APP. I CONNECTED THE LOGITECH C270 which ring detected without any problem but when I made the call to my friends (which I tried on 2 different platform which were android and ios phone) and I was able to receive the audio perfectly but my audio was totally unclear to them.", "completion": "Two questions:\n1. Is it detected by your system?\n2. Is it available in other applications?###"}

{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nHigh mobile data consumption\nI experienced high and excessive mobile data consumption on a Samsung and a Huawei device.\nJami was used on both devices for about 3 hours. Less than 15 text messages were exchanged between both devices. On both devices the 'share location for 1 hour' function was enabled twice.", "completion": "Hi, on mobile, the best thing to have a limited data consumption is to disable syncing with the rest of the DHT network and enable the DHT proxy with push notifications support.###"}
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nGMS is not FOSS but without GMS the client can't receive message and drain the battery. Could you please support unified push?", "completion": "It's indeed a must have feature.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nAdd new contact to chat with, hanging on Downloading conversation from peer\nI have just installed GNU Jami on my phone and computer, and also on my mothers' phone. We both set up accounts, and she added me as a contact. So far so good.I saw the invitation appear in my client, so I clicked it to accept it, and now on both her and my installation, it just says "Downloading conversation from peer", and hasn't changed since the invitation was accepted (about 3 hours ago from the time of me writing this).", "completion": "To initalize a swarm conversation, one side must download the first part of the conversation created by the other. So, it will be downloaded whenever both sides are online (or with the next detected presence change).###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nPlease enable online status to be set (with corresponding colors):  Online/absent/busy", "completion": "For now it's indeed not possible, but may be in the future. However, the presence is on the DHT and it will be always detected (to encrypt messages), so the offline status will not exist.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nBeing serverless is an amazing thing I found out about Jami. I want to fully host/build my own android and ios apps and I do not want to depend on any of jami services or if possible, other external services as well.\nI see in the docs about installing own turn server. This left me thinking that what are other things in addition to a turn server that I would need to launch fully self owned apps.", "completion": "This article https://jami.net/why-is-jami-truly-distributed/ list:\npush notifications\nthe OpenDHT proxy\nbootstrap\nname server\nTURN.\nFor Turn, you said that you did it.\nFor the name server it's here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-project/wikis/technical/Name-Server-Protocol\nFor the bootstrap it's here (and DHT proxy): https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/wiki/Running-a-node-with-dhtnode\nFor push notifications: https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/wiki/Push-notifications-support\nHowever, push notifications are a specific case if you want to support it. Indeed, it's Google (or Apple) who owns the server that will send notifications. Authentification is done via a certificate which signs the app. So, if you want your push server, you will have to regenerate yourself the binaries for iOS and Android.\nBut Jami can also work without any Turn server, but yeah if you replace turn.jami.net by yours, all features should work. Also a lot of documentation is on https://docs.jami.net.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nProvide changelogs for all updates\nEspecially for the client updates. Many people who are not so technique affine are often just annoyed - in my perception - of constantly doing updates. A friend recently asked me what the update of his Jami Windows client actually changed/improved. Unfortunately I couldn't tell him either. This would probably change if people understood - maybe before the updates - why they should do the update.", "completion":"There is a changelog dedicated page in the wiki of the project.###" }
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nIt would be really great to be able to discover other Jami users on the local network.", "completion": "This feature is available in the account settings (enable local peer discovery)###"}
{ "prompt": "Answer to this issue:\n\nAdd a way to recover usernames.\nMy suggestion is that the usernames become free after a while (eg after 6 months of inactivity). That way active users would have the opportunity to recover or use their favorite usernames.", "completion": "It depends the nameserver, but the default one doesn't register any personal informations, so there can't be somewhat like I forgot my password. However if you host your own nameserver, if it's following the REST API (it's in the doc), you can implement whatever you want###" }
